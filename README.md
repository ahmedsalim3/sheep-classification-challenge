# Sheep Classification Challenge

A deep learning solution for classifying sheep breeds using semi-supervised learning. The project tackles a small, imbalanced dataset with smart data mining techniques and Vision Transformers.

ðŸ‘‰ Check the [project page](https://ahmedsalim3.github.io/sheep-classification-challenge/), it walks through everything: training strategy, tricks used, and what worked (and what didn't)


## How to install

1. Clone this reop

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ahmedsalim3/sheep-classification-challenge.git
cd sheep-classification-challenge
```
2. Install dependencies

```sh
make install
```

## Configuration

Edit YAML file in [`config.yml`](./configs/config.yml) to configure the paths, output directories, and training parameters

## Dataset

The dataset is hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sheep-classification-challenge-2025/data).
YTo download it automatically:

```sh
`make download-data`
```

Make sure your Kaggle credentials are set correctly [here](./scripts/download_dataset.sh#L11)

## Training

Run training with:

```sh
make train
# or just:
python scripts/train_cv.py
```

It supports clean training, pseudo-labeling, clustering, and full semi-supervised loops

## Results

All final logs, metrics, and plots can be found inside the [here](./results/) folder
